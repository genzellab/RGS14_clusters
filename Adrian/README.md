# HMM analysis

- prepare_markov.m: Function created to test the analysis using a single study day. It preprocesses the data of a NREM bout and displays it. Continue the analysis running 'demo2_HMM_Simple.m'

- veh_rgs_data_for_hmm.mat: Structure which contains all data needed for HMM analysis from Vehicle study days of the RGS14 project. Generated from 'prepare_markov_nontrial.m'.

- prepare_markov_nontrial.m: Generates the spikes and spikes_peak structs in the format needed for the hmm analysis.
